## Introduction

Conversational agents based on LLM (Large Language Models) such as OpenAI ChatGPT or Google Bard have the potential to 10x productivity of employees by retrieving concise answers to complex questions with the ability to compose, translate and rewrite. With plugins, they also have the capability to interact with other API and complete tasks on behalf of users. 

The CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) AI Lab is currently prototyping solutions using OpenAI LLM (Large Language Model) ChatGPT and reaching out to all organization stakeholders to work with them at experimenting tasks that can be assisted by the use of LLM.

## Objective

Create a conversational agent against our public and private knowledge base that can reliably and accurately provide relevant and focused answer to questions related to the CFIA to all users.
